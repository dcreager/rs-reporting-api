//! This crate provides some useful Rust code for working with the [Reporting API][] and [Network
//! Error Logging][] W3C draft specifications.
//!
//! [Reporting API]: https://w3c.github.io/reporting/
//! [Network Error Logging]: https://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging/
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The core of the [Reporting API][] is pretty simple: reports are uploaded via a `POST` to a URL
//! of your choosing.  The payload of the `POST` request is a JSON-encoded array of reports, and
//! the report schema is defined by the spec.
//!
//! The [Reporting API][] can be used to upload many different _kinds_ of reports.  For instance,
//! Reporting itself defines [crash reports][], [deprecations][], and [interventions][], all of
//! which come from the JavaScript environment running in the browser.  Other report types are
//! complex enough that they need to be defined in their own specs, such as [Network Error
//! Logging][] and [Content Security Policy][].  Regardless of where they're defined, each report
//! type defines some fields specific to that type (the **_body_**), and the [Reporting API][]
//! defines some fields that are common to all types.
//!
//! [crash reports]: https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#crash-report
//! [deprecations]: https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#deprecation-report
//! [interventions]: https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#intervention-report
//! [Content Security Policy]: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/
//!
//! This library provides a definition of all of these schemas as regular Rust types, along with
//! the ability to use [serde][] to serialize and deserialize them.  We've carefully defined
//! everything so that [serde_json][] will automatically do The Right Thing and use a JSON
//! serialization that lines up with the various specifications.  We also provide way to define
//! body schemas for new report types, and have them seamlessly fit in with the rest of the
//! serialization logic.
//!
//! [serde]: https://docs.rs/serde/
//! [serde_json]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/
//!
//! # Collecting reports
//!
//! The simplest way to use this library is if you just want to receive reports from somewhere
//! (you're implementing a collector, for instance, and we've already defined Rust types for all of
//! the report types that you care about).
//!
//! To do that, you just need to use `serde_json` to deserialize the content of the JSON string
//! that you've received:
//!
//! ```
//! # use reporting_api::BareReport;
//! # let payload = r#"[{"age":500,"type":"network-error","url":"https://example.com/about/","user_agent":"Mozilla/5.0","body":{"referrer":"https://example.com/","sampling_fraction":0.5,"server_ip":"203.0.113.75","protocol":"h2","method":"POST","status_code":200,"elapsed_time":45,"phase":"application","type":"ok"}}]"#;
//! let reports: Vec<BareReport> = serde_json::from_str(payload).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! That's it!  The elements of the vector will represent each of the reports in this upload batch.
//! Each one is a "bare" report, which means that we haven't tried to figure out what type of
//! report this is, or which Rust type corresponds with that report type.  Instead, the raw body of
//! the report is available (in the [`body`][] field) as a `serde_json` [`Value`][].
//!
//! If you know which particular kind of report you want to process, you can use the bare report's
//! [`parse`][] method to convert it into a "parsed" report.  For instance, if you know you only
//! care about [Network Error Logging][] reports:
//!
//! ```
//! # use reporting_api::BareReport;
//! # use reporting_api::Report;
//! # use reporting_api::NEL;
//! # let payload = r#"[{"age":500,"type":"network-error","url":"https://example.com/about/","user_agent":"Mozilla/5.0","body":{"referrer":"https://example.com/","sampling_fraction":0.5,"server_ip":"203.0.113.75","protocol":"h2","method":"POST","status_code":200,"elapsed_time":45,"phase":"application","type":"ok"}}]"#;
//! # let reports: Vec<BareReport> = serde_json::from_str(payload).unwrap();
//! // Ignore both kinds of failure, returning a Vec<Report<NEL>>.
//! let nel_reports = reports
//!     .into_iter()
//!     .filter_map(BareReport::parse::<NEL>)
//!     .filter_map(Result::ok)
//!     .collect::<Vec<Report<NEL>>>();
//! ```
//!
//! [`BareReport`]: struct.BareReport.html
//! [`body`]: struct.BareReport.html#structfield.body
//! [`Value`]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/*/serde_json/value/enum.Value.html
//! [`parse`]: struct.BareReport.html#method.parse
//!
//! Note that [`parse`][]'s return value is wrapped in _both_ [`Option`][] _and_ [`Result`][].  The
//! outer [`Option`][] tells you whether or not the report is of the expected type.  If it is, the
//! inner [`Result`][] tells you whether we were able to parse the reports `body` field according
//! to that type's expected schema.  In this example, we therefore need two `filter_map` calls to
//! strip away any mismatches and errors, leaving us with a vector of `Report<NEL>` instances.
//!
//! [`Option`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html
//! [`Result`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html
//!
//! # Creating a new report type
//!
//! This should be a relatively rare occurrence, but consider a new report type that uses the
//! [Reporting API][] but that isn't covered here.  For instance, let's say there's a new `lint`
//! report type whose body content looks like:
//!
//! ``` json
//! {
//!     "source_file": "foo.js",
//!     "line": 10,
//!     "column": 12,
//!     "finding": "Indentation doesn't match the rest of the file"
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! First you'll define a Rust type to hold the body content:
//!
//! ```
//! # use serde::Deserialize;
//! # use serde::Serialize;
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, PartialEq, Serialize)]
//! pub struct Lint {
//!     pub source_file: String,
//!     pub line: u32,
//!     pub column: u32,
//!     pub finding: String,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Lastly, you must implement the [`ReportType`][] trait for your new type, which defines the
//! value of the `type` field in the report payload that corresponds to this new report type.
//!
//! [`ReportType`]: trait.ReportType.html
//!
//! ```
//! # use reporting_api::ReportType;
//! # pub struct Lint;
//! impl ReportType for Lint {
//!     fn report_type() -> &'static str {
//!         "lint"
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! And that's it!  The [`parse`][] method will now work with your new report type.
